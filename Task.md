### Description

Please expand your existing RSI-based backtest script by adding a position sizing or stop-loss mechanism, then compare strategy performance (e.g., Sharpe ratio, drawdowns) against your original version. Storing the results in a CSV or chart will provide clear evidence of whether your risk controls improve overall returns. This task refines your quant skills, adheres to your strategic focus on trading enhancements, and produces tangible value for your future decisions.
